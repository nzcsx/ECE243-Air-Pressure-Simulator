# ECE243_Air_Pressure_Simulator
## Description:
This is an air pressure simulator demonstrating the effect of ideal gas law.

##Instruction:
- Press and release KEY3 to switch the HEX display between P(pressure in Pascal), V(volume in
cub ic meter), T(temperature in Kelvin) and n(the number of atoms).
- Press and release KEY2 to increase the value of V, T or n.
- Press and release KEY1 to decrease the value of V, T or n.
- Press and release KEY0 to reset the value of P, V, T or n to default value.
- Observe the change of moti on of atoms on the VGA display due to change of V, T , n
- Observe the change of P(pressure value) on the HEX display due to change of V, T , n
