# ECE243_Air_Pressure_Simulator
This is an air pressure simulator demonstrating the effect of ideal gas law. You can change volume, temperature and the amount of gas particles present. The application will calculate the air pressure, and visually simulate the collision of particles. 

## Installation
It does not need to be installed. It is intended to run on the website CPUlater. 
- Go to website CPUlator.
- Choose ARMv7 - ARMv7 DE1-SoC, and click go. 
- Choose language as C near the top. 
- Copy the source code in project.c into the window.
- Click Compile and Load, then click Contintue. 

## Usage
- Press and release KEY3 to switch the HEX display between P(pressure in Pascal), V(volume in
cub ic meter), T(temperature in Kelvin) and n(the number of atoms).
- Press and release KEY2 to increase the value of V, T or n.
- Press and release KEY1 to decrease the value of V, T or n.
- Press and release KEY0 to reset the value of P, V, T or n to default value.
- Observe the change of moti on of atoms on the VGA display due to change of V, T , n
- Observe the change of P(pressure value) on the HEX display due to change of V, T , n
